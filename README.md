# THE ULTIMATE MOD LIST

In 6th grade (late 2021), I made a list of Minecraft mods for every day of the year, January 1st to December 31st. I do quite like this list, feel free to take a look, I guess.

This has become a little outdated, because it is over 3 years old. It will definitely become more outdated lol.

Some mods seem a little out of place, but they're there because I was trying to have a reference to some things (e.g. Aug 10 is a really obscure and stupid mod, but I wanted a BATIM reference).

mcmods.txt - The original from 2021.
mcmodstogames.txt - Something I've been doing for fun recently.

Question not my ways, young ones.
